# C_file_decryption
file_decryption_system_lab

counterpart program to the C-file-encryption system lab

1.) needs to have amount of source text files (5 by default)

2.) key settings that were used to encrypt

3.) total amount of true characters in the source text files (+5 eof) essentially just the total length of encryptedFile

4.) the encrypted text file

5.) as output it recreate original text files to readable form

actually there may have been a small bug that an additional eof character is appended to each of those decrypted files. 
(looks like an Ã¿ character or something like that)
but otherwise the sources in decrypted files should be visible and legible
